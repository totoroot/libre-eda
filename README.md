EDA Symbols for [LibreOffice Draw](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/draw/)

Just a library of symbols I used for my reports and papers for university
as well as some of the circuits I created.

## Why?
Usually it was not necessary to use a full-fledged EDA to create
the simple circuits I needed to aid my written explanations.

Although there are Free EDAs which support exporting images quite nicely
they often lack symbols for the bulky devices we have and
use in our laboratories such as a oscilloscope or a lab bench power supply.

Since I study in Europe all symbols included are the European types and
should look at least similar to the symbols specfied by some DIN or ISO standard.
It should be noted that I did not care about full compliance with the standards.

## Requests
If you need any symbols, simply open an issue and link to an image of a missing
symbol or modify the file yourself and open a pull request.
